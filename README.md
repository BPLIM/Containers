# Containers

This repository presents procedures and templates for working with Singularity containers at BPLIM. Within each statistical framework, containers are designed to address specific needs. For example, one container facilitates the use of Apache Parquet with Stata, while another provides support for machine learning in Python.

<!--- In the `Manual` folder, you'll find a guide on how to build and use containers for Julia, Python, Stata, and R. -->
